‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.

1. Clone the repository

Bash

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
2. Install dependencies for the backend

Navigate to the backend folder and install the dependencies.

Bash

cd backend
npm install
3. Configure environment variables

Create a .env file in the backend directory with your database connection string and JWT secret.

PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<a_long_secret_string>
4. Run the backend server

Bash

npm start
5. Install dependencies for the frontend

Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend folder, and install the dependencies.

Bash

cd ../frontend
npm install
6. Run the frontend application

Bash

npm run dev
The application should now be running on http://localhost:5173.

üîí Authentication & Authorization
This application uses a JWT-based authentication system with a role-based access control. The frontend uses custom components (PrivateRoute and AdminRoute) to protect routes, while the backend uses middleware to secure API endpoints based on the token's validity and the user's role.
